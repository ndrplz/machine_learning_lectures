### Lab lecture - Linear regression in Tensorflow
This lecture is about implementing a linear regression and train
it by gradient descent, exploiting the automatic differentiation
engine provided by Tensorflow. We'll see how to discover the relation
between the weight of brain and body for a number of mammal species.
